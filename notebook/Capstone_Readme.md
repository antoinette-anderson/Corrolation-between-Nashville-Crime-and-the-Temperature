When speaking to my boss, he was telling the story about how his mother was worried to leave her car out while at a sporting event in Michigan. He turns to her and say, "It's 14 degress outside! No one is going to steal your car!"

This prompted my research to examine the relationship between Nashville and temperatures.

I used the dataset from Nashville Incidents from 2023 and data from NOAA for my weather. I wanted to know the following questions:

1. Does warmer temperatures = more crime overall or just violent crime?
2. What is the relationship with crime in extreme temperatures? Is it less so or only less of a specfic crime?
3. What is the normal range of temperature in which crimes are committed?


In my research, I have found that all crime in Nashville mostly happens during warmer climate regardless of the type of crime. During extreme temperatures however, whether it is too hot or too cold, all crime is down. Temperatures were ranged by 10s and with my findings, most crime occurring when it was in the 80s.
